# System Monitoring Stack
A lightweight monitoring stack for Linux systems using Netdata, Prometheus, and Grafana.
This setup allows you to collect, store, and visualize system metrics, with a preconfigured Grafana dashboard to quickly detect anomalies such as unusually high numbers of open sockets or TCP connections (e.g., during Slowloris-like attacks).

# ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Before starting, you need to install and configure Netdata on the host machine.
